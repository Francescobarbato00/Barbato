  <p>
    My journey into web development began during high school, where I first experimented with{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">HTML</span> and <span className="font-semibold">CSS</span>. 
    I was fascinated by how simple code could transform into visually appealing web pages. As I grew 
    more comfortable with these fundamental technologies, I started exploring{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">WordPress</span> and its powerful ecosystem of themes and plugins. 
    Tools like <span className="font-semibold">Elementor</span> allowed me to build functional websites quickly, 
    while integrating custom <span className="font-semibold">CSS</span> for tailored design solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    As my interest in programming deepened, I transitioned into more dynamic development by learning{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">JavaScript</span>. This marked a turning point as I started building 
    interactive user interfaces and rich web applications. I focused on modern frameworks like{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">React</span> and later{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">Next.js</span> for server-side rendering and optimized performance. 
    To complement these tools, I incorporated <span className="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</span> to streamline 
    the design process and improve scalability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving beyond the frontend, I explored backend development with{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">Node.js</span> and added support for{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">PHP</span>-based solutions. Initially, I worked with{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">relational databases</span> like{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">MySQL</span> and tools such as{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">phpMyAdmin</span> for structured data management. Over time, I expanded 
    into <span className="font-semibold">non-relational databases</span> like{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">MongoDB</span> for projects requiring more flexible data storage. 
    This allowed me to create robust full-stack applications with secure data management and high scalability.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also gained experience in API integration and development, using{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">RESTful APIs</span> to connect frontend and backend services seamlessly. 
    For deployment and version control, I leverage tools like{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">Git</span> and platforms like{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">GitHub</span> to maintain codebases efficiently. Additionally, I use{" "}
    <span className="font-semibold">Vercel</span> and <span className="font-semibold">Netlify </span> 
    for fast and reliable deployment of frontend projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current focus is on building secure, performant, and accessible digital products that deliver 
    an <span className="font-semibold">exceptional user experience</span>. I am passionate about writing 
    clean, maintainable code and keeping up with the latest web technologies to continually improve 
    my development process.
